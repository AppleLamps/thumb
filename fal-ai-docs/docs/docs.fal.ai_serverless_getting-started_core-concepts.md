## [​](https://docs.fal.ai/serverless/getting-started/core-concepts\#app)  App

An **App** is a Python class that wraps your AI model for deployment. Your app defines what packages it needs, how to load your model, and how users interact with it.

```
class MyApp(fal.App):
    machine_type = "GPU-H100"  # Choose your hardware

    def setup(self):
        # Load your model here
        # Executed on each runner

    @fal.endpoint("/")
    def generate(self, input_data):
        # Your endpoint logic here—usually a model call
```

## [​](https://docs.fal.ai/serverless/getting-started/core-concepts\#where-code-runs:-local-vs-remote-execution)  Where Code Runs: Local vs Remote Execution

### [​](https://docs.fal.ai/serverless/getting-started/core-concepts\#what-runs-locally)  What runs locally

- Module import / top level: When Python imports your file, all top-level code executes on your machine.
- This is where you typically define helpers, constants, and construct objects you might pass to the app.
- Building the app object: The class body for your app is defined locally (like any Python class).
- Serialization boundary preparation: When you reference local objects from the app (e.g., myobj), we attempt to pickle them locally to ship to the remote runtime.

### [​](https://docs.fal.ai/serverless/getting-started/core-concepts\#what-runs-remotely)  What runs remotely

- Class transfer & instantiation: Your fal.App subclass is **pickled locally**, then **unpickled and instantiated remotely** in the runtime you configured (e.g. requirements, container image, etc.).
- App methods / entrypoints: Methods of your app class (e.g. `setup`, `@fal.endpoint`s, etc) execute on the remote machine.
- Referenced symbols:  - Pickled objects (closures, small data, simple classes) are shipped as part of the app payload.
  - Importable code (installed packages or modules present in the remote image) is imported remotely instead of being shipped.

```
# --- Local (import-time) ---
import os
import fal
import json

# Local constant (pickled if referenced).
# Environment variable comes from the local environment.
CONFIG = {"myparameter": os.environ["MYPARAMETER"]}

# Local helper (pickled by definition if referenced - code is not executed locally).
def myhelper(x):
    # Runs remotely
    import mylib
    return mylib.helper(x)

class MyApp(fal.App):
    def setup(self):
        # Runs remotely once on each runner
        # Load deps from remote environment (fast, deterministic)
        import mylib  # must be installed in remote image/requirements or dynamically installed before this line
        self.pipeline = mylib.load_pipeline()

    @fal.endpoint("/")
    def generate(self, input: MyInput) -> MyOutput:
        # Runs remotely on each request
        result = self.pipeline(input, k=CONFIG["MYPARAMETER"])
        return MyOutput(result)
```

## [​](https://docs.fal.ai/serverless/getting-started/core-concepts\#readiness-&-liveness)  Readiness & Liveness

### [​](https://docs.fal.ai/serverless/getting-started/core-concepts\#at-start)  At start

Fal considers an app as ready to serve requests immediately after the `setup()` method finishes successfully. If there is no `setup()` method, the app is considered ready as soon as the application web server is up.It is highly advisable to always use `setup()` to load necessary data and even perform a dummy evaluation to ensure that things work end to end.If `setup()` does not complete successfully or the web server port never opens, the runner is immediately terminated as unhealthy, and no requests forwarded to it.

### [​](https://docs.fal.ai/serverless/getting-started/core-concepts\#ongoing)  Ongoing

Ongoing app readiness/liveness is determined based on the status codes it returns to requests:

- `2XX` status codes indicate a successful request (app is alive and ready)
- `4XX` status codes indicate a user error and are not retried (app is alive and ready)
- `503` status code indicates the runner is not healthy. The request is retried (when using the queue) and the runner is immediately terminated.
- `504` status code indicates that an upstream dependency is not healthy (but the app itself is). The request is retried, but the runner is not terminated.
- Other `5XX` status codes are not retried and the runner is not terminated

There are 2 additional states in case the app misbehaves:

- The connection with the app breaks (e.g. the app crashes): requests that use the queue are retried, direct requests get a `503` status. The runner is shut down.
- The app takes longer to respond than the request timeout: requests that use the queue are retried, direct requests get a `504` status. The runner is shut down as it may be faulty.

### [​](https://docs.fal.ai/serverless/getting-started/core-concepts\#health-check)  Health Check

You can add a health check endpoint to your application to ensure that your runners are healthy and ready to serve requests.
If the health check fails for a few consecutive times, the runner is terminated and a new one is spun up.See [health check endpoint docs](https://docs.fal.ai/serverless/development/add-health-check-endpoint) for details.

## [​](https://docs.fal.ai/serverless/getting-started/core-concepts\#machine-type)  Machine Type

**Machine Type** specifies the hardware (CPU or GPU) your app runs on. Choose based on your model’s needs: `"CPU"` for lightweight models, `"GPU-H100"` for most AI models, or `"GPU-B200"` for large models.

## [​](https://docs.fal.ai/serverless/getting-started/core-concepts\#runner)  Runner

A **Runner** is a compute instance that executes your app using your chosen machine type. Runners automatically start when requests arrive and shut down when idle to save costs.

## [​](https://docs.fal.ai/serverless/getting-started/core-concepts\#endpoint)  Endpoint

An **Endpoint** is a function in your app that users can call via API. It defines how your model processes inputs and returns outputs.

### [​](https://docs.fal.ai/serverless/getting-started/core-concepts\#playground)  Playground

Each endpoint gets an automatic **Playground** \- a web interface where you can test your model with different inputs before integrating it into your application.

## [​](https://docs.fal.ai/serverless/getting-started/core-concepts\#fal-run-vs-fal-deploy)  `fal run` vs `fal deploy`

- **`fal run`**: Test your app on a single cloud gpu during development. Creates a temporary URL that disappears when you stop the command.
- **`fal deploy`**: Deploy your app to production. Creates a permanent URL that stays available until you delete it.

Use `fal run` while building and testing, then `fal deploy` when ready for production use.
